Hold onto your hats! Stacks and queues are the lawmen of efficiency. Whether you're stacking plates at a saloon or waiting in line for the chuckwagon, we've got you covered.

## The Dueling Trees

Time to climb the mighty data trees! ðŸŒ³ From binary to AVL, we'll be branchin' out into the wilderness of hierarchical structures. Get ready for a treetop showdown!

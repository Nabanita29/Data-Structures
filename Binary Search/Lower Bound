The lower bound of an array is when the smallest nums[index] which is greater than or equal to the target given

In nums[] = [3,5,8,15,19] where target = 9; the answer will be 15

CODE
public class Solution {
    public static int lowerBound(int []arr, int n, int x) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = n-1;
        int ans = n;

        while(low <= high){
            int mid = (low + high)/2;
        
        if(arr[mid] >= x){
            ans = mid;
            high = mid-1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }   
        
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
